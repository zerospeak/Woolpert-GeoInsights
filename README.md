The diagram above illustrates the platform's architecture with color-coded components:

- Blue components represent the frontend layer, handling user interactions
- Green components show the core backend services
- Purple indicates data-related components
- Orange highlights security elements
- Yellow represents AI/ML capabilities

Data flows from client interactions through secure APIs, passing through the security layer before reaching the core processing components. The AI/ML engine and real-time integration services work together to process and analyze data, which is then stored and retrieved as needed.
